Albeit, it's been a couple years, I was on the executive team of my high school student council where I planned many large-scale events and also took meeting minutes and managed meetings as Director of Internal Communications. I would love to be VP Finance again next year so I can continue to improve my work in the role and continue to get involved in the wonderful initiatives Ada's Team has (hopefully in person).`,

I’ve been involved with and a huge fan of Ada’s team since I joined as a general member in my second year. I’m so utterly grateful for the experiences and mentorship I’ve gotten from Ada’s team and its initiatives, especially in getting to where I’m at now. Currently, I’m in Toronto working for Uber as a Software Engineer Intern and will be going to San Francisco next summer to intern for Slack. Previously, I worked at Intuit and this could not have happened had it not been for Ada’s team and its initiatives helping me out so much. That being said, I’ve been blessed with opportunities to network and make connections at these internships - ones that I’d like to leverage if elected for VP Industry Outreach. I’ve always loved events like Coffee && Code and hope to continue those events by reaching out to existing and potential partner organizations to host. I know that University of Alberta students are interested and excited when it comes to industry partners, and I’m ready to show these partners exactly that since our students have a lot to offer as well. I’m excited to bring more professional development opportunities to such an enthusiastic group. So, the plan is to show partners this enthusiasm and to start conversations between UAlberta students.`,

    Some highlights of my work as VP Digital Media this year include creating fun merch for our initiatives (namely, Ada's Conferences @ GHC), as well as building up our Ada's Team Discord server as a club staple and homebase for our community throughout the university's shifts from in-person to online (and vice versa). I also had the immense honour of co-leading ProtoJam, Ada's Team's (and Alberta's first) UX/UI Designathon. Not only I developed and upkept a whole new brand identity from the ground up, but I also gained outreach and event planning skills that I could use to support my fellow executives beyond my role' responsibilities. 
    
    I want to continue strengthening Ada's Team's visual presence and branding, both online and in-person, to both our current community members and future members. I believe that a combination of my accomplishments as VP Digital Media and my design experience would make me a good fit to further carry on the role to do so.
    
    Thank you so much for your time, and I hope you consider me again for Ada's Team's next VP Digital Media!`,

    speech: `Hello everyone, I’m Justine Ventura and I am running for the roles of VP Campus Outreach, VP Industry Outreach, and VP Conference Operations. This past year I served as VP Campus Outreach where I liaised with other campus organizations and gave many presentations to WISEST, HIP, TeamUp Science among others. I was also responsible for promoting the group to the student body through events like Clubs Fair wherein I promoted the club to 100+ new students who joined our newsletter. I also assisted with other Ada’s Team events such as getting speakers for our ProtoJam Designathon and setting up some of our coffee and code sessions by working alongside our VP Industry Outreach. I would love another opportunity to contribute to Ada’s Team and I think I can use what I have learned this year to make the 2022-23 year even better! I plan to increase engagement with our members through incentives. For example, attending 3 c&c or other Ada’s team events in a semester will give you a chance to win prizes. I also want to conduct a survey at the start of the year to see what events people are most likely to attend and would be interested in. Finally, I want to expand our campus outreach and make our presence more known through social events like game nights and mixers. I think community building is a key aspect of Ada’s Team and it would be great to create that tight-knit community feel. I think that I am a responsible and dedicated leader and I hope you vote for me! Thank you.`,

    speech: `Hello everyone, my name is Katie, I’m the current VP Industry Outreach at Ada’s Team, and I’m running for VP Conference Finance and VP Conference Campus Relations. Over the past two semesters, I got the chance to work with a team of great execs. Together, we were able to bring 8 Industry workshops (AKA Coffee && Code sessions) from some pretty big companies, like Intuit, Google Deepmind, & Microsoft, for our club members. I really enjoyed hosting these workshops and serving our community, and I want to continue my service for the upcoming year as well. 

    Going from Industry outreach to Conference related positions may seem like a stretch at first glance, but both roles share common core elements of event hosting, organization, and outreach. As a VP for the Grace Hopper Conference, I will be the liaison between our sponsors, the faculty, and GHC attendees. I know that GHC provides invaluable industry resources, company connections, and networking opportunities, as a 2 time attendee myself. So it is my goal to secure funding to send as many applicants to GHC as possible. I will also heavily promote GHC to Ada’s team members and other interested students. Carrying over some industry connections from this year, I can help host technical workshops for outgoing attendees, as well. Lastly, I will coordinate the distribution of awesome GHC swag. I want every attendee to feel prepared for the conference, so that they can thrive and be at their best when networking & career opportunities arise. 
    
    Having learned the do’s and don’t’s of being an Ada’s Team exec, I believe my current experience will help me succeed in the roles I’m running for. Please vote for me as VP Conference Finance OR Conference Campus Relations, and I will do my best to deliver a smooth, pleasant conference experience to you!

It was an unprecedented pleasure serving you this past year and I really hope to continue some of the work that we started. My main focus this year was maintaining and improving some of the already amazing initiatives that we led. We also had our share of new things, namely the ProtoJam designathon, which was so fun to organize. I am so proud of the team and all that we accomplished, and I hope we can continue to accomplish these amazing feats!

    Unfortunately, and I am sure most of you are aware, but there has been a consistent pattern of misogyny in our very own department, and that has become more clear to me during my presidency. I am so glad that a lot of you are comfortable in the safe spaces that we provide, and while it is a pleasure serving you, it is always so heartbreaking to hear what many of you have to go through as students. This is why Ada's Team is so important to me – without this group, I genuinely believe that I would have left my program.
    
    So, what am I planning to do about it? Well, I'm glad you asked, because I will need everyone's help to make our learning environment inclusive to all. First, I would like to make Ada's Team known to more people, that way our great community can be a safe space to even more people. Second, I would like to work with our department to figure out what we can do together to tackle this issue. Third, and this one will be exciting to the job-seeking folks here, I would like to partner with more organizations that share our vision to make sure that our members have access to nurturing work environments as well as learning environments. And lastly, but certainly not least, I want to hear more of your thoughts and experiences – I would like to start a conversation that accounts for as many diverse perspectives as possible. I'd like to create an anonymous form on the Ada's Team website where you can come with all of your wonderful ideas and infuriating frustrations, and I would like to address them.
