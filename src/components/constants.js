    speech: `Hello everyone! My name is Helen, I’m in my fourth year of computing science, and the positions I’m running for in order of preference are President, VP Conference Relations, and VP Conference Finance. 

    First off, I just want to say Ada’s Team is literally my life and anyone that knows me well know that I live and breathe this student group. It’s everything that I stand for in being a diverse individual and an ally In tech especially as I feel like a lot of people don’t even realize their potential as I certainly didn’t when I first joined CS.  This is why I’m so passionate about creating spaces and opportunities for everyone to understand their power and facilitate the advancement of their careers.
    
    I’ve been involved with Ada’s Team for 3 years and an exec for 2. The past two years, I’ve been on the conference team and in total have sent 51 people to 6 conferences for more than $40K. And in saying that, I’m trying to communicate that I’m accustomed to high responsibility and pressures. I mean, just this year we sent 24 people to 2 conferences and I organized this during my Intuit internship and taking a full course load. So when I say Ada’s Team is my priority, it really is and that’s because the group’s mission is important and can have a huge impact on you. I want to empower you and help you build your confidence. I want to take you around the world, connect you with big tech companies whether it be through conferences, hackathons, etc that may have been inaccessible to you before. Also, I want you to have a strong network and sense of community at school.
    
    All in all, that’s why I’m running for president and why it’s my preference. I’d appreciate your vote. Thank you! `,

      "Hi everyone! My name is Katherine Patenio, and I am currently VP Conference Internal at Ada’s Team. I am running for VP Admin and VP Conference Relations (new name for my current role).\n\nFor those who don’t know me, I am an undergrad CS student minoring in French, and I’ve been an exec since November 2018. Ever since I’ve joined Ada’s Team, I made new friends, learned new skills, and finally found a sense of belonging in CS; in fact, I consider Ada’s Team to be my second family. My main reason for being an exec is to give back to the community that has helped me become who I am today.\n\nI’ve worked with the Conference Team to interview and fund more than 20 students to attend the CAN-CWiC and GHC conferences. Aside from my Conference duties, I represented Ada’s Team in various events and even organized a couple myself, including a successful Intuit office visit a few months ago.\n\nAs VP Admin, I want to try out a new role with new responsibilities. I want our future execs' voices to be heard. I’m also a firm believer in giving people a chance; by being involved in the Election Committee, I can do what needs to be done in order to give others the opportunity to develop themselves and be better leaders.\n\nAs for VP Conference Relations, a lot of my experience transfers over to this role. I’ve already gone through the process of conference planning. I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t; I hope I can also use this knowledge to advise new Conference execs.\n\nOverall, I hope to continue my role as an exec (either as VP Admin or VP Conference Relations); it would mean a lot to me if I could still give back to the community that I call family. Thank you for your time, and I hope you consider me for either position!",

      "Hey! I’m Monica a 3rd year CS student running for Conference Relations, VP Communications, and Admin respectively. Just a disclaimer before I start is that you should NOT vote for me if you know me as a person, you should be voting for the best people who could do the job well for Ada’s Team and its mission. I’m so excited to see so many old and new faces running for roles and everyone speaking today is fully capable of doing the job so please take a chance to vote for them!\n\nAnyways back to my actual speech. My journey in Ada’s Team has definitely been a wild ride. I first started hosting office hours way back in late 2017 when the office space was just starting to open their doors up more throughout the day, then it turned into going to GHC, and now fast forward today I got to meet so many new and amazing people from all different backgrounds, it's definitely been an exhilarating experience. I think many execs are surprised that I’m running and to be frank I’ve always been adamant on helping Ada’s Team from the OUTSIDE IN, through office hours and volunteering. But now after going through research, internships, many outside projects, and various industry events and especially going into my last year in uni, I really want to share this wealth of knowledge to the rest of the student body and it’d be totally selfish of me to keep that all to myself. I think my main goal is to help jumpstart the community through sharing my experiences to help better enable students to chase after these amazing tech opportunities. I see that the best way to do that is through helping Ada’s team from the INSIDE OUT instead.\n\nThanks for listening in on my speech and I hope you take the chance to vote for the best person for the position. Best of luck to everyone :)",

This year I was VP Admin at Ada’s Team where I was responsible for tutoring and room sitting hours.\n\nMy journey with Ada’s Team has been amazing. We have collaborated together in the success of events and our main goal to support diversity in computing, games, and technology at UofA. This club provides us with so many resources from being able to attend Conferences to tutoring. For me, Ada’s Team is like a family in which we all of us support each other and strive for the best, and that’s why I want to continue being part of it.\n\nThe positions I am running for are VP Industry Outreach and VP Admin. I believe I am a good candidate for Industry Outreach because I’m good at networking and connecting with companies. I also enjoy organizing events. In fact, I coordinated the Github Workshop along with another exec. That shows that I’m able to collaborate in groups which we’ll be an important skill when working with the VP Campus Outreach. In addition, this past year I’ve developed the necessary skills that would help me succeed and improve in my role as VP Admin for another year.\n\nThank you so much for your attention and support!!!

I have nothing but great experiences with Ada’s Team and I volunteered for various events such as AutumnFest and the GitHub workshop. This club has been one that I’ve been looking for throughout my university degree and is one that I would love to put my efforts into. I have experience working with teams and the most important thing I value is communication between all team members. I always make sure that the people I’m working with feel like their voice is valued. On my own, I bring the best quality of work and have it done a few days earlier than usual. I am a very technical person that keeps track of all the little details.\nThis translates to my academic life such as keeping my assignments and code clean with lots of comments for my team members and my personal life such as having my own Excel sheet to keep track of my own finances and an additional app which is why VP Finance is my first choice. I would love to be able to bring the skills I know surrounding tracking and money for Ada’s Team but also learn additional skills on what it would be like to work for a bigger club.

Although we have accomplished many great things this year such as receiving a grant for $50,000, successfully voiced concerns regarding course structures to the department and much more, my proudest actions as President stems from my dedication to my team. An underlining purpose of a student group should be to help students grow as leaders and as people. Because of this I consciously made efforts to provide feedback to my executive team in the form of a one on one meeting where they were encouraged to reflect on their performance and Ada's Team as a whole. Furthermore, due to my own reflections I know there is so much more for me to do as an executive of Ada's Team.

It took time, but I eventually learned more and more about my role and how to better serve the team.

As for how I got involved with Ada's Team, and why I would be a good fit for the executive board this year; I first got involved when I was sent to the 2017 CAN-CWiC conference funded by Ada's Team and got to see women within this field succeed in avenues that I didn't think was possible. Since then it's been my mission to send those that are the most vulnerable and those that are hesitant to think that this field is for them, to these conferences so that they can find role models for themselves and realize that success is possible for those coming from their background. This dedication to empowering  those that are diverse in a growing field that often times employers are still prejudiced against, is my passion and why I think I would be a good fit as an executive member for Ada's Team. Please vote for me for VP-Conference Finance, I bring new ideas that will streamline and refresh the system, all while making it easier for my successors to not make the same mistakes that I did.

I am currently in my fifth year of Computer Engineering and over the past couple of years, I have been involved and on the executive team for many different clubs on campus including the General Faculty Council, a VP for the Iranian Students’ Association, and a VP Engineering Students’ Society. I live for problem-solving, bringing people together and helping others become more successful.  I am here to bring value to Ada’s team with my preference of positions being Industry Outreach first, then Campus Outreach. 
      I have been involved with Ada’s Team for a while. For instance, this past January I presented a workshop on Exploiting Top Web Vulnerabilities on behalf of Ada’s Team at HackED. This was one step I made in my goal in spreading Ada Team’s mission. This workshop was co-presented by a Cyber Security Analyst from Deloitte, and this is just one instance of how I reached out to a big company, brought them to campus, and added them to Ada Team’s network. 
      Through my experience of job hunting and networking at conferences such as Grace Hopper, I know that expanding networks can only be accomplished through fearlessness in contacting as many companies as possible and being unafraid of hearing ‘no’. By taking advantage of my computer engineering network, Ada’s current network of industries, and reaching out to other industries on LinkedIn. I know we can multiply the presence of big tech companies and internships offered to our members, and I am passionate and excited to help other students obtain these opportunities.
      As your future VP Industry Outreach, my focus is to create opportunities and give you access to tech companies you wouldn’t have had outside of Ada’s Team. I will facilitate your networking with different companies, employers, HR, and mentors. I will fearlessly reach out to companies so you can elevate. This club is here for you, so let us provide you with the best opportunities!

I was first introduced to Ada’s team in my second year when I attended one of the monthly meets for helping students out and I was pleasantly surprised by the positive and warm atmosphere. That motivated me to come back as a tutor the next year which made me meet more members of the team. Not long ago I met a few of you at the Hackathon and enjoyed my time a lot. What I love about Ada’s team is that I feel so comfortable with everyone unlike our classes where everything feels competitive. I would love to be a part of such a highly motivated and warm team so that I can help others have a positive experience with Ada’s as well. Thank you !!",

      "Hi, my name is Celina and I will be going into my third year in the fall. I am running for VP communications. I really enjoy being part of the CS community because there are a lot of clubs and groups to take part in, such as UACS, the programming club, and Ada's team.\n\nI think Ada's team is great for sending out CS related events. I've seen various emails about scholarships, start-up workshops, information sessions with companies like Intuit, activities from other CS related clubs, and more. I want to help out Ada's team to make sure we can keep on showing students their opportunities so that they can get experiences outside of their academics.\n\nThe reason why I think I'm fit for VP communications is because I like sending out emails and organizing them. If I get this position, I will have a new way to chill out from studying.",

      "Hi, I'm Diane and I'm going into my last year of CS at the U of A. I'm running for the positions of Conference External, Communications, and Digital Media but the main position I am interested in is Digital Media. I used to be an Ada's Team exec, in the 2018/2019 academic year, but I did not run for exec in 2019/2020 due to other responsibilities I had which were taking up most of my time. However, I now have plenty of time to dedicate to Ada's Team so I have decided to run again this year. \n\nThere are many reasons why Ada's Team is important to me. First, I have met many of my friends at university through Ada's Team. Ada's Team has given me the opportunity to travel to so many different places and attend conferences which have made me feel empowered as a woman in computing science and I want to help others feel the same way. Finally, people from Ada's Team have always been there for me. Recently I went through a very difficult time in my life and I tried to cope with this by shutting myself off from my friends, but everyone in Ada's Team was still there to support me. Ada's Team really means the world to me which is why I am so passionate about being an exec and giving back by volunteering my time. \n\nI am primarily running for VP Digital Media because it is most similar to my previous exec position which was VP Promotions and I have all the necessary skills to do well in this position. During my past time as VP Promotions the Ada's Team Instagram account doubled in followers. The main reason why I am passionate about this role is because I understand the potential social media has to make a positive impact on people's lives, and in the past my favourite thing about being an exec was that I was able to spread Ada's Team's values of inclusitivity and diversity through social media. Furthermore, I have lots of experience doing visual design, including being hired as an independent contractor to do UI design for a project for the National Research Council of Canada. This translates into strong skills when it comes to designing advertising for Ada's Team events, such as posters. \n\nThank you all for your time and I hope you will consider voting for me for an executive position.",

      "For those who are not familiar with me, my name is Zubier Hagi and I plan on running for VP Conference Relations, VP Conference Operations, and VP Industry Outreach in the 2020-2021 school year.\n\nLooking back, when I took my very first computing science course, I noticed it was a lot to take in as a student. From the unrealistic expectations and demands to the relentless number of hours spent studying in solitude by cramming concepts for a midterm or final. When you think about it though, it was quite worth it as it opened up different opportunities and perspectives that I may have never experienced if I hadn’t chosen this school.\n\nDuring these last few years, I’ve been wanting to give back by being supportive and friendly to my fellow students. Yes, I may be a bit of an introvert or not well-known, however I promise to promote diversity in computing, games and technology along by providing assistance to everyone as much as a I can. By being a representative of Ada’s Team, I will try my best to shed my knowledge and experience for other as we all adapt to challenge ourselves to be better every day.",

This year I am going to run for VP Academic and Campus Outreach. The main reasons for voting me are: first, I am the scholar of Peter laughed leadership college, I have good skills in leadership and collaboration.

Second, I am good in academic, we are using the elections app today, I am the second contributor of this app. I will be the ideal candidate of managing the tutor program and also since lots of my Chinese are good in Programming, as the commit, I will ask them to get more involved with Ada’s. Third, I am good  in campus outreach, I have good connection with WISEST program leader, I just connected with one founder of them and she is my mentor of the leadership college.

      "Good afternoon everyone, I am Ian and I would like to have your support to be elected as Vice President of Finance at Ada’s Team. I am a four-year computer science major student and I am currently working as a student coop developer at RBC headquarter. I believe that the VP Finance position requires a person who is well equipped with strong organizational, communication and leadership skills. I have always desired to be in an environment that allows me to utilize and sharpen my skills attained and acquired previously as a student leader at the University of Alberta and volunteer positions. During the last year fall semester, I have worked as a program coordinator at the residence. As I got to work closely with everyone on the team, I have observed and learned some knowledge in budget planning and financial documentation, which I think will be helpful for me to prepare myself for this position. If I am elected, I’d also like to explore more sponsorship as well as collaborations with the external community such as RBC bank as I have learned that RBC Early talent acquisition team has been constantly looking to collaborate with different universities. Finally, I would love to be part of Ada’s team in my last year of university in order to give back to the community and be your VP Finance. Thank you so much for your support.",
