		speech: `Greetings fellow technology enthusiasts! My name is Courtenay and I'm entering my last year of Computer Science Specialization, also completing the Game Development Certificate. I want to be VP Communications for Ada’s Team because communication is key, not only within a workplace, but within any community. No one can benefit from workshops, panel discussions, or other events without knowing about them. However, communication is a two-way street! I want to hear your feedback: if half of us are stuck in a lab 5-8 on Tuesdays, maybe we avoid events in that time slot or make sure to have them recorded. If there’s topics people are interested in, maybe we put effort into getting an expert panel together. Besides the exciting connections Ada’s Team has to the industry, I also want to connect you all to one of our biggest resources- each other. Technology is giving us superpowers, but whether you’re a DC or Marvel fan, I think we can agree that even superheroes are better as a team. We might not save the world in the same way, but the positive changes we can make together will brighten the future. Thank you for considering me as your preferred candidate for VP Communications for 2022/23!`,
