Throughout all my time here, I felt empower for the first time to achieve everything I proposed, to start believing in myself and be capable of doing great things. Ada's Team fostered a friendly and supportive community where anyone could rely despite of our differences. Ada's Team helped me realize my potential, and I want to help pave the way for others to do so as a VP Conference - Operations, as part of the Conference Team. I have previously attended the Grace Hopper Conference where I experienced and learned how important is to include diversity in Tech. There are going to be many challenges with most likely virtual conferences but that doesn't stop us from providing a high quality experience, when at the end of the day it's to provide the resources to be successful. `,

    Hello everyone! I’m Amanda Nguyen, hoping to be your next Ada’s Team President and I have a confession to make: I am not a natural leader.

    Just a year ago, I joined Ada’s Team as a first time executive and was excited to just participate and provide what I could as your VP Finance. However, as time went on, I wanted to do more and had the opportunity to help lead one of our big initiatives, Ada’s Students: which aimed to help students that were struggling through their first and second year com sci classes just like I did. I stressed over organizing and was worried that there wasn’t going to be enough interest from both tutors and students. Luckily, I was proven wrong and was met with a huge community of students wanting help and even more importantly, a community of students that was passionate about volunteering and sharing what they have learned. 
    
    I know now that being a great leader is not one that has all the answers but one that recognizes the immense potential of the people around them and simply provides opportunities for them to grow. I am in a unique position where a majority of our executive team will be new to Ada’s Team and I want to be the leader that listens and amplifies their voices because in doing so, will make the greatest impact.
    
    Like I said, I am not a natural leader but I have been a student that needed tutoring help. I have been an executive that wasn’t sure of where to even start. The right person to be president doesn’t have to be a natural leader but simply someone that is dedicated on learning and growing alongside Ada’s Team and the computing science community.`,

I've also helped host a number of events for WISEST and YSIC that aimed to promote STEAM for underprivileged students who might not otherwise get the opportunity to get hands-on experience with science and technology. These initiatives and experiences go hand in hand with Ada's Team's goal of promoting diversity and inclusivity on computer science and STEAM in general.

    I have been involved with Ada's Team for the past two years and this past year had the pleasure of being our VP Campus Outreach. I have really loved my time as part of the executive team and am excited to have the opportunity to continue it and welcome new members to the Ada's Team family.

    Some of you might recognize me from the fall cohort in Ada’s Developers, which is a bootcamp-like initiative that allows students to work together in teams on a project over the course of a semester using industry norms. Having been part of the Ada’s Team website team in Ada's Developers since September of last year, I truly feel like the website is near and dear to my heart. The reason I am running for the position of VP Digital Media is because I would like to continue to work on it, polish it to best fit the club's image. As your VP for digital media, I will ensure that the club’s branding and online presence is consistent, aesthetic and regularly updated, delivering news and student opportunities on the different platforms as soon as they come. 
    On the other hand, my previous position as Vice President for the Undergraduate AI Society has taught me a lot about what it means to be the right-hand (wo)man to the president. I’ve learned about the different ways a club can be run depending on its size and goals, taking note of what went well, and what didn’t. As your VP Admin, I will be an aide to not just the president, but also the other executives and members. 
    
    I would appreciate your vote for me for either VP Digital Media or VP Admin. Ada’s Team has done a lot for me since my first year, and I will do my best to give back to the club that’s gotten me to where I am today.`,

    I am someone who strongly values brand identity, and whether or not an organization puts their best foot forward in terms of their visual presence. Ada's Team has kept a strong visual presence for their community, both online and in person, so as their VP Digital Media I want to continue to uphold that. 
    
    I have served as VP Design/similar roles for other student groups, where I managed social media platforms and created promotional content for events. I also have a strong design background that would be very beneficial to this position. As some of you may know, I am a designer for a number of Ada's Developers projects that have already allowed me to further contribute to this club's visual presence. 
    
    Ada's Team has provided us with so many opportunities for professional development that I'm grateful for. To give back, I want to uphold their message. I want others to know about Ada's Team and the opportunities it provides so that other students can also realize their potential. Even before I got involved with this club, just having known about Ada's Team, and what they stand for, gave me confidence that I can succeed as a minority in tech; which is why it would mean a whole lot to me to be your next VP Digital Media.`,

    Well, since I was a 5-year kid. I liked the stars, planets, and robots. And in middle school, I met a NASA scientist during an event. He worked on Hubble Telescope and discovered a galaxy. After the event, I talked to him for quite some time. That's one of the best days of life. And I feel so good about Ada's Team because they organize events where University students can interact with researchers, developers, designers and many others. Being a part of Ada's Team, I want to increase the frequency of such events. I want to bring people from a variety of fields to share their experience. I attended a Microsoft PM event by Ada's, and now I am working as a Project Manager at Ada's Developer. I attended a Google event, and one of the developers from the panel is currently helping me with some Open Source projects. These events are seriously awesome. I want everyone to get benefited from them. That is the reason I want to join Ada's team :)`,

I’m running for VP Campus Outreach because I would love to work with the rest of Ada’s Team Outreach team to spread the word to prospective members at events like Clubs Fair and Student Dev Con. Student Dev Con is where I actually heard about Ada’s Team and met Chelsea and other Ada’s Team execs at the time. I was so excited to meet kindred spirits in the comp sci department and I would love to be part of bringing that experience to other students at events on and off campus. Now more than ever, it’s essential to have connection and build community throughout campus to support one another, build together, and have fun. To this end, if you elect me VP Campus Outreach I would prioritize seeking out collaboration opportunities with groups on campus for Ada’s Team to team up with and encouraging more comp sci students to join us. 

    I’m also running for VP Academics because I value the academic supports Ada’s Team has offered through the study groups and tutoring, which helped me get through 204. As VP Academics I will continue facilitating and expanding tutoring and office hours to reach even more students throughout the department. Having had experience TAing CMPUT 174, I have an understanding of what new students to the department need in terms of support including more example problems, tutoring, and particularly while school is still online Ada’s Base office hours will be essential for providing academic support, building friendships and a comp sci community. In terms of advocacy to the department that’s a responsibility I would certainly take seriously and by working in collaboration with the rest of the Ada’s Team exec and with feedback from students like yourself I would be honored to represent your concerns to the department so we can all make the most of our learning experiences`,

This year, I was personally involved in each of those initiatives: as a project manager in Ada's Developers, a tutor for Ada's Students and Ada's Tutors, and co-director for Ada's Mentors. I was able to see the executive team in action, as well as learn from and contribute to Ada's Team's initiatives.

This is something I already kind of do by letting people in CompE and engg know about the cool events Ada’s team puts on, and I can definitely do this same promotion at clubs fair. 

    As well I would be a good liaison between Ada’s team and other campus clubs as I have friends who are execs on clubs such as UAWise/WISEST and TeamUp Science. I have spoken to them about how their events transitioned during COVID so I’m excited about possibly working with them in the future.

For this reason, I would love to be a part of Ada’s team to help these individuals like myself learn about possible career routes or opportunities and to discover their true passion. 
    
    Out of the executive positions, I am running for VP Communications because I believe my experiences and skills will be highly beneficial if applied to this role.
